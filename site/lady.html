<p>That Arizona sky
    <br>
    Burnin' in your eyes
    <br>
    You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
    <br>
    It's buried in my soul
    <br>
    Like California gold
    <br>
    You found the light in me that I couldn't find
    <br>
    
    So when I'm all choked up but I can't find the words
    <br>
    Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
    <br>
    When the sun goes down
    <br>
    And the band won't play
    <br>
    I'll always remember us this way
    <br>
    
    Lovers in the night
    <br>
    Poets tryin' to write
    <br>
    We don't know how to rhyme but, damn, we try
    <br>
    But all I really know
    <br>
    You're where I wanna go
    <br>
    The part of me that's you will never die
    <br>
    
    So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
    <br>
    Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
    <br>
    When the sun goes down
    <br>
    And the band won't play
    <br>
    I'll always remember us this way
    <br>
    
    Oh, yeah
    <br>
    I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
    <br>
    
    Oh, oh, oh
    <br>
    So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
    <br>
    Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
    <br>
    When the sun goes down
    <br>
    And the band won't play
    <br>
    I'll always remember us this way
    <br>
    Way, yeah
    <br>
    
    When you look at me
    <br>
    And the whole world fade
    <br>
    I'll always remember us this way</p>
