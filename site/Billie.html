<p>Thought I found a way
    <br>
    Thought I found a way out (found)
    <br>
    But you never go away (never go away)
    <br>
    So I guess I gotta stay now
    <br>
    
    Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
    <br>
    Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
    <br>
    Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
    <br>
    Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
    <br>
    
    Isn't it lovely, all alone?
    <br>
    Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
    <br>
    Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
    <br>
    Hello, welcome home
    <br>
    Walkin' out of town
    <br>
    Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
    <br>
    Something's on my mind (mind)
    <br>
    Always in my headspace
    <br>
    
    But I know someday I'll make it out of here
    <br>
    Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
    <br>
    Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
    <br>
    Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
    <br>
    Isn't it lovely, all alone?
    <br>
    Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
    <br>
    Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
    <br>
