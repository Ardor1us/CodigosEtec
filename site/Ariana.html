<p>Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
    <br>
    Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
    <br>
    When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
    <br>
    'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
    <br>
    
    It all just sounds like, ooh
    <br>
    
    Too young, too dumb to realize
    <br>
    That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
    <br>
    Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance
    <br>
    Take you to every party, 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
    <br>
    Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man
    <br>
    
    My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
    <br>
    Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
    <br>
    Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
    <br>
    And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
    <br>
    
    It all just sounds like, ooh
    <br>
    
    Too young, too dumb to realize
    <br>
    That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
    <br>
    Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance
    <br>
    Take you to every party, 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
    <br>
    Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man
    <br>
    
    Although it hurts
    <br>
    I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
    <br>
    Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
    <br>
    To try and apologize for my mistakes
    <br>
    But I just want you to know
    <br>
    
    I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
    <br>
    Give you all his hours when he has the chance
    <br>
    Take you to every party
    <br>
    'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
    <br>
    
    Do all the things I should've done
    <br>
        
    When I was your man
    <br>
    Do all the things I should've done
    <br>
    When I was your man </p>
